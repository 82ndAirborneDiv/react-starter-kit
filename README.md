# CDC React Starter Kit
The project is a simple starter kit for creating new React based projects at CDC. The goal is a simple and light configuration with standards that were discussed and agreed upon by developers who work here instead of using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) which has a lot of things that we don't need and things that don't work well in our hosting environments.

### Keep it Simple
Modern front-end development has become very complex. The most important guiding principle of this starter kit is to keep things simple and easy to understand. We want to make it easy for anybody looking at the code to understand what is happening so they can extend and modify things to suit their specific needs. Adding extra steps into the build process should be considered carefully and discussed amongst the team.

### Roadmap
* Make sure all necessary polyfills are in for IE11 and any other assistive packages
* Add in scaffolding for context/very large state
* Finalize code linting standards based on feedback
* Add optional TypeScript support
* Finalize README

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the needed packages
3. Run `npm start` to start up the development server. It should open your default browser with the URL and refresh to reflect code changes you make upon save.

### Building

To build the project, run `npm run build` and it will compile everything down into bundle.js.

This folder works in a self contained way so you can put it on a server and it will load the index.html or you can take that bundle.js file and include it on a different page, as long as you have a container element with the same ID that is specified in `index.js` for React to lock onto and render inside of.

**Note: Please use NPM, not Yarn to prevent multiple lock files.**

## High Level Setup Overview

This section describes the major underlying components of the project and how they all fit together. A clear overview should make it easy to make changes.

**Babel**
This parses the JavaScript in the project and transforms it into code that can be supported by older browsers. It lets you use newer ES6 style syntax and still support IE11 Notably, Babel is also the step in the process that turns the easy to read JSX into more traditional JavaScript objects. Note, you will still have to sometimes use additional polyfills outside of Babel, that is why Core JS is also included in this project.

**Webpack**
Similar to older projects like Gulp and Grunt, this is the main "task runner" for the project. It is responsible for the following:
* Starting the dev server and auto refreshing when changes are saved.
* Compiling SASS into CSS
* Handling the build process when the code is ready to be used in production

The configuration is stored in `webpack.config.js` it is recommended that you look at the Webpack documentation before trying to edit it.

**ESLint**
This checks and enforces code quality when you commit so that the code is standardized among all developers.

## Best Practices and Recommended Extensions

React has been around for a long time, and there have been several popular paradigms to code in that have come and gone. To keep things simple, we're trying to use a similar style both in actual syntax as well as using React features and third party packages.

**Use AirBnb coding style**
There is a linter built in that enforces this when you commit your code.

**Use hooks and functional components**
Whenever possible, you should be building your components as functions and use hooks to manage local state.

**For larger state management, use the Context API over Redux**
There are examples of this in the code. While other libraries like Redux have been a very popular solution to use with React projects for a long time, it adds quite a bit of boilerplate code and is largely unnecessary except for very large projects and it's another library that developers have to learn. Generally, you should always start simpler and only add additional layers if they're really needed.

Obviously if there's a need, we can be flexible here but best to discuss with the architects and come to a consensus.
